Components needed for payload system
- Arduino Uno R4
- Micro SD card reader & microSD card
- 9V battery
- BMP 280 (pressure sensor)
- SparkFun 9DoF IMU Breakout (ISM 330 DHCX & MMC5983MA)	(position sensor)


The BMP 280 sensor is recording temperature (Â°C) and pressure (Pa). Based on the pressure values from the sensor altitude (m) is being calculated. These values are being saved to the SD card in a .txt file every two seconds
