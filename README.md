### About
The BMP 280 sensor is recording temperature (Â°C) and pressure (Pa). Based on the pressure values from the sensor, altitude (m) is being calculated. The data from this sensor can be plotted using the MATLAB script "Plotting_Pressure_Data". The ISM330DHCX sensor records acceleration (mg) and gyroscope angular velocity (mdps). Data from both sensors are saved to the SD card in separate .txt files every two seconds. 

### Software Needed
MATLAB is needed in order to run the file "Plotting_Pressure_Data". 

Before running any of the sensor collection programs, install the following libraries in the Arduino IDE:
* Adafruit Unified Sensor
* STM32duino ISM330DHCX
* Adafruit BusIO
* Adafruit BMP280 Library

### Hardware Needed
Components needed for payload system:
* Arduino Uno R4
* Micro SD card reader & microSD card
* 9V battery
* BMP 280 (pressure sensor)
* SparkFun 9DoF IMU Breakout (ISM 330 DHCX & MMC5983MA)	(position sensor)

### Setup
The I2C addresses of the sensors do not conflict, so both sensors can be connected to the same I2C bus without issues.
If using the Qwiic connectors, the blue wire is for SDA and yellow for SCL. On an Arduino Uno the I2C pins are: A4(SDA) and A5(SCL)

It is recommended to use screw terminal blocks to secure wires during launch.
